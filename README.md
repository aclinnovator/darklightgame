##About Color and Movement


Darklight is a unique puzzle game about the relationship between color and movement - where the world is in your control. It poses one simple question: what if light not only affected behavior, but also movement? Have full control over the beautiful environment to guide Gumli to the moon. 

You must Guide a cute character named Gumli to the moon. Interact with different elements in the environment to move Gumli and guide him to the portal at the end of every level.
